# AI Hackaton Data

## Description
In general, provided data contains scraped web pages from Google search results.

Each search result has fields: `search_result_id`, `keyword`, `search_date`, `country_language_code`, `country_name`, `city_name`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `device`(mobile or desktop), and 20 first webpages ordered by field `position`. Each webpage has `url`, `content_score`(calculated with Surfer's rules), `title`(from HTML head) and two content columns: `content_sections` and `content_unstructured` extracted from its HTML. `content_unstructured` is whole page content concatenated into one great string. `content_sections` is structured and much cleaner representation. A single section consists of `heading`, `heading_level` and `content`. For the curious: `content` are simply merged \<p> paragraphs under given heading.

Collected data is multilingual, but 70% of searches are in English. You can go multilingual or limit scope to `en` only, we are totally ok with it.

There are about 21,000 search results, each containing 20 webpages. That gives 420,000 scraped webpages and millions of sections.

## Tasks
We propose several tasks that can be accomplished using given data but teams are **very welcome to propose own ideas** how to leverage Surfer's data.
Our tasks:
* Keyword extraction
* Revealing most important words/phrases/topics
  * unsupervised way, e.g. finding most frequent words but excluding stopwords
  * supervised way, with use of page position, kind of Google reverse engineering
* Paraphrasing
* Text completion
* Whole article generation (list of unique headings with contents based on scraped websites)
* Check if `seo score`, calculated with Surfer rules, correlates with page positions in search result
* Find interesting dependencies in data
* Visualise data in a nontrivial way
* ... your tasks, just have fun!

    ],
    inplace=True,
)
```
## Sampling
Collected data comes from last 4 months. To sample it, simply cut scope to fewer months, e.g last 2 months. Alternatively you can take alternate days.

## Presentations
We'd like you to present project results on 5-10 minutes presentation. Presetation may be a story that answers below questions:
- what kind of data you used?
- what task you solved?
- what you discovered?
- how accurate is proposed solution?
- what you learned?
- what can be done in the future?
  
Send presentation link to maciejgruszczynski@surferseo.com, please.

Cheers !
